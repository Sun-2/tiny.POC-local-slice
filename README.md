# Component-level redux slices with autogenerated actions

A messy POC of a state management solution that lets you utilize the goodness of Redux (and @reduxjs/toolkit) without global state.

* autogenerated actions (courtesy of `@reduxjs/toolkit`)
* zero prop drilling
* performant - only subscribers whose part of context changed do rerender (courtesy of `redux-context-selector`)
* narrow api surface
* no boilerplate
